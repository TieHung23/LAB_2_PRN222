# EVDMS - Electric Vehicle Dealership Management System

This is a comprehensive management system for an electric vehicle dealership, built with .NET.

## Technology Stack

- **.NET 9**: The core framework for building the application.
- **ASP.NET Core**: For building the web application.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For data access and database management.
- **SQL Server**: The database used to store the application data.

## Project Structure

The solution is divided into several projects, each with a specific responsibility:

- `EVDMS.sln`: The solution file that contains all the projects.
- `EVDMS.Core`: Contains the core entities and common models of the application.
  - `Entities`: Defines the database models (e.g., `Account`, `Customer`, `VehicleModel`).
  - `CommonEntities`: Contains common properties for entities like `CreatedCommon` and `UpdatedCommon`.
- `EVDMS.DAL`: The Data Access Layer, responsible for all database interactions.
  - `Database`: Contains the `ApplicationDbContext` and database migrations.
  - `Configuration`: Handles dependency injection for the DAL.
- `EVDMS.BLL`: The Business Logic Layer, containing the application's business logic and services.
  - `WrapConfiguration`: Handles dependency injection for the BLL.
- `EVDMS.Presentation`: The presentation layer, which is an ASP.NET Core MVC web application.
  - `Controllers`: Handle user requests.
  - `Views`: The UI of the application.
  - `wwwroot`: Contains static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
